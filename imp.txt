CRUD operations
create -> post method  eg:@app.post('/post)
read -> get  eg:@app.get('/posts/{id}') -> to get info about specific post
     -> get eg:@app.get('/post)
update -> put or patch   eg: @app.put('/post/{id})   
        for put we have  to send all data again, but in case of patch only the changes are sent
delete -> delete    eg:@app.delete("/post/{id}") 


In fastapi the order of the routes that you have decalared matters it finds the first match and returns it 

as i move the main.py file to app folder to start the server  uvicorn app.main:app --reload

*****ORM's PART*****

Sqlalchemy dooes not know how to talk with python so we need database driver so right now fo postgres we are usinfg
psycopyg2 that's how orms work
engine is responsible for connection of postgresql and Sqlalchemy

def get_db():  This will get database connection and it will give a session

pydantic models what they do is we have create a schema for that like this 
class Post(BaseModel):
    title:str
    content:str
    published:bool=True
so what they do is checks whether the user inputs the correct field in it so and then they send back to it 

In Sqlalchemy model we update create all the operationsare done in python alone so that we don;t worry about the sql queries
